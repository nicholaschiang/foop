# Functional Object Oriented Programming

Repository for Gunn High School's FOOP (Functional Object Oriented Programming)
class that contains the solutions for the second semester assignments using
Java (first semester uses Simply Scheme which isn't included here). See 
[Mr. Paley's website](http://paleyontology.com/foop/) for the course timeline.

## System Requirements

Most systems will already have a JDK (Java Development Kit) installed. You can
check the version by running:

```
$ java --version
```

For me, the pre-installed Java distribution outputted the following:

```
openjdk 11.0.9.1 2020-11-04
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.9.1+1-Ubuntu-0ubuntu1.20.10)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.9.1+1-Ubuntu-0ubuntu1.20.10, mixed mode, sharing)
```
